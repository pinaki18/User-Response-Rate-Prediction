# User-Response-Rate-Prediction

## Problem Statement 
Predicting a click, as the first measurable user response, is an important step for many digital advertising and recommendation systems to capture the user's propensity to follow up
actions, such as purchasing a product or subscribing a service.
“Our aim is to implement an efficient response prediction algorithm i.e Click through rate Prediction for online advertising.”

## Novelty of the problem
One of the significance of this project is that it can help assign useful advertisements to the users thereby saving users time by not viewing advertisements which are not useful for them. Moreover this project helps in avoiding the cold start problem occurring within the companies as this project already segregates users on the basis of their entities.

## Conclusion
From this project we can conclude whether a particular user is clicking on the ad or not (CTR value). We can do this by comparing user response with other users' response to that particular ad for which we want to calculate the CTR value. This CTR value will tell us whether that particular user is keen in clicking the specified ad or not. Comparing the above implementation models, we conclude that Logistic Regression gives us the maximum accuracy for determining the click through rate (CTR), click probability. We believe in the future there will be fewer ads, but they will be more relevant. And also these ads will cost more and will be
worth it.
